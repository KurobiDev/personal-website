        About me
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name's Not Important, you can call me Kurobi, BlackFlame, Flame etc. I am from a small city in Poland and I have been learning HTML since 2016. Currently I'm studying computer science.

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>
        Overall my interests cover up mostly computers and retro stuff - old video games, old hardware like consoles and old PCs. My second main interest is anime and manga, though I sporadically watch anime, I'm more a reader.
