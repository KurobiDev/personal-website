        I have made this website as means of expressing myself as well as having some sort of portfolio. It's design is mainly influnced by old website designs, most notably ROBLOX's site design from 2006 to 2010. <br>
        I like reading manga, playing video games, shitposting and programming stupid web mini-projects.

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>
        Overall my interests cover up mostly computers and retro stuff - old video games, old hardware like consoles and old PCs. My second main interest is anime and manga, though I sporadically watch anime, I'm more a reader.
