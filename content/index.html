        Welcome to Kurobi's site!
    </h1>

    <p>
        This is my personal portfolio of sorts. I mainly inspired it's design by early 2000s websites. <br>
        I'm a beginner programmer and an avid gamer, who loves old FPS games such as DOOM, Quake, Half-Life and Unreal. <br>
        Currently I am trying to make mods for those games as well as make my own retro-styled FPS with it's own story. <br>
        Other than that, I am also trying to learn how to draw.
    </p>

        Hope you enjoy your stay. <br>
