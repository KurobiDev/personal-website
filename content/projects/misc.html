        <h3>Private NAS Server</h3>
        <p>
            A tiny project I did in a day. <br>
            It's a simple NAS I set up on a Raspberry Pi, running on a Samba server. <br>
            I intend to store mainly saved memes as well as text projects. <br>
            I plan to expand the storage size of the server, as well as add a streaming service, that will allow me to stream audio and video on it. <br>
            <br>
