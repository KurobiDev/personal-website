        <h3>Private NAS Server</h3>
        <p>
            A tiny project I did in a day. <br>
            It's a simple NAS server I set up on a Raspberry Pi, running on a Samba service. <br>
            I intend to store mainly some saved memes as well as text projects. <br>
            I have plans to expand the storage of the NAS server, making it serve it's purpose for more, than just storing memes and documents. <br>
            <br>
