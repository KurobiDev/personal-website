        <h3>Private Network Storage</h3>
        <p>
            A tiny project I did in a day. <br>
            It was a simple NAS server I set up on a Raspberry Pi, running on Samba. <br>
            I intended to store mainly some saved memes as well as text projects. <br>
            Recently dismantled it - running a NAS on a pendrive is a horrible idea. <br>
            <sup>(The pendrive is still fine.)</sup>
