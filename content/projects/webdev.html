        <p>
            Well, it was my first time at developing a fully functional website, but here it is - my personal website you are visiting right now.

        <img src="{{ nesting }}assets/images/template.png" alt="Gacha Incremental" width="200">
        <h3><a href="webdev/GachaClicker">Gacha Incremental</a></h3>
        <p>
            A small HTML + JS project I decided to develop for fun. It's basically a joke clicker based on Blue Archive's infamous gacha mechanic, with three rarities and lots of expected 9 blue + 1 yellow pulls.
