<div class="introduction">
    <p>
        DOOM was one of the games I started creating mods for first. Mainly I aimed for creating mods for more vanilla ports of DOOM. It was a great first choice for ease of map making as well as still-high popularity of the game.

            A <em>Tribute</em> WAD made in memory of late controversial Polish celebrity - Krzysztof Kononowicz.
            The map depicts the infamous wooden house located on Szkolna 17 Street in Białystok, Poland. <br>
            It was my first released WAD, so do not expect much quality from this.
