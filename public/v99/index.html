        <h2>
            Welcome to BlackFlame's site.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here I'm mostly presenting my work including art and developing video games. I'll also cover various topics including video games, computers, anime and manga and rarely some personal stuff as well.

            This website is meant to be a fun project - what if I made a personal website like when Windows 98 or Windows 2000 were still around. It's still usable in modern web browsers, but it's recommended to be visited on an old hardware, preferably with 800x600 resolution
