/* 
    Handle the periodic theme changes

    Right now it is an empty script, where I plan to write a function, that would check, if the system date is a specific date. 
    For instance I'd introduce a site theme, that would activate only when it's my birthday or when it's christmas persiod (24th of december to 26th)

    The script should run when the site loads.
