                    This is my personal portfolio of sorts. I mainly inspired it's design by early 2000s websites. <br>
                    I'm a beginner programmer and an avid gamer, who loves old FPS games such as DOOM, Quake, Half-Life and Unreal. <br>
                    Currently I am trying to make mods for those games as well as make my own retro-styled FPS with it's own story. <br>
                    Other than that, I am also trying to learn how to draw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope you enjoy your stay. <br>
